EARTHQUAKE MAP

This code is written as a part of the programming assignment of Object Oriented Programming in Java course offered by UC San Diego through 
Coursera.
This is a Java pApplet application which shows the live earthquake data with the help of markers. This also shows whether a city will get 
the effects of nearby earthquakes or not.


TROUBLE SHOOTING
